Here we'll keep a list of potential ideas to add in the project

We're using a markdown file.

Steps for use in vscode->
1. Install the extension - 'Markdown all in one'
2. Then split the editor using 'Ctrl + /' or or the split option at top right.
3. After that click the right window to select it and press 'Ctrl+Shift+V'. This will change it to view mode.
4. Now you can edit in the left window and see the preview in the right one

# Ideas
 - Add Item-drops after an enemy is killed
    - Like health boost
    - Increased bullet damage
    - Increased movement speed
    - Or 2x points buff
 - Make enemy move in the x-axis as well rather than just in the y-axis
 - Make different type of enemies
